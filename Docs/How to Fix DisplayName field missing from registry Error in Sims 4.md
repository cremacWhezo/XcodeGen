In this article, we will explain what causes this error and how to fix it with some simple steps.
 
## What Causes "DisplayName field missing from registry" Error in Sims 4?
 
This error typically means that Origin, the game launcher for Sims 4, cannot verify your ownership of the game. This can happen for various reasons, such as:
 
- You are signed into the wrong Origin account that does not own Sims 4.
- Your antivirus or firewall is blocking Origin's connection to EA servers.
- Your game files are corrupted or missing.
- Origin is having issues or undergoing maintenance.

## How to Fix "DisplayName field missing from registry" Error in Sims 4?
 
Depending on the cause of the error, you can try different solutions to fix it. Here are some common methods that have worked for other players:

1. **Sign into the correct Origin account.** Make sure you are using the same Origin account that originally installed Sims 4, or in the case of a Steam install, the one linked to the Steam account that owns Sims 4. You can check your Origin game library to see if Sims 4 is listed there. If not, you may need to sign out and sign in with a different account.
2. **Set exceptions for Origin and Sims 4 in your antivirus or firewall.** Sometimes, your security software may interfere with Origin's connection to EA servers and cause this error. To prevent this, you can add Origin.exe and TS4\_x64.exe (the executable files for Origin and Sims 4) to your antivirus or firewall's whitelist or exception list. You can find these files in your Origin installation folder and your Sims 4 installation folder respectively. For more details on how to set exceptions for different antivirus or firewall programs, you can refer to their official websites or support pages.
3. **Repair the game files.** If your game files are corrupted or missing, you may encounter this error as well. To fix this, you can use Origin's repair function to scan and fix any issues with your game files. To do this, open your Origin game library, right-click on the Sims 4 icon, and select Repair[^2^]. When you do this, run Origin as an admin: right-click on its shortcut and select "Run as administrator." Run both Origin and Sims 4 as an admin when you try to play as well.
4. **Wait for Origin to resolve its issues.** Sometimes, the error may be caused by Origin itself, such as when it is having server problems or undergoing maintenance. In this case, there is not much you can do except wait for Origin to fix its issues. You can check Origin's official website or social media accounts for any updates or announcements regarding its status. You can also contact EA support for more assistance if the error persists.
